# SteinNS
This repository contains the code for the paper [Stein Neural Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03545). We implemented the KSD Neural Sampler (with the RBF or IMQ kernels) and the Fisher Neural Sampler in TensorFlow. 

## Toy example
The toy example is an equal mixture of eight Gaussians equally spaced on a circle of radius 15. The red lines indicates the target distribution, and the green points represents the 2000 samples at each iteration.
